Environment Variables
---------------------

The BatBot API and CLI have two environment variables (envars) that allow you to configure global settings
and configurations.

   - ``VERBOSE`` (default: not set)
      A verbosity flag that can be set to turn on debug logging.  Defaults to "not set", which translates
      to no debug logging.  Setting this value to anything will turn on debug logging
      (e.g., ``VERBOSE=1``).
